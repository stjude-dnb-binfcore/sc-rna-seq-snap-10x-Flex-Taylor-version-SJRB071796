# Using Analysis Modules in scRNA-Seq Snap 10x-Flex Workflow

This repository contains a collection of analysis modules designed to process and analyze single cell and single nuclei RNA (sc/snRNA) data from **10X Flex** sequencing technology. 

Each module is self-contained and can be executed independently or as part of a larger analysis pipeline. Below is a summary of each analysis module, including whether they are required or optional. Furthermore, the analysis modules should be run in the following recommended order:

1. `fastqc-analysis` module (description="Pipeline for FastQC quality control tool for high throughput sequence data analysis.", required=True)
2. `cellranger-analysis` module (description="Pipeline for running and summarizing Cell Ranger count for single or multiple libraries.", required=True)
3. `upstream-analysis` module (description="Pipeline for estimating QC metrics and filtering low quality cells.", required=True)
4. `integrative-analysis` module (description="Pipeline for Integrative analysis.", required=False)
5. `cluster-cell-calling` module (description="Pipeline for cluster cell calling and gene marker analysis.", required=True)
6. `cell-types-annotation` module (description="Pipeline for annotating cell types.", required=True)
7. `rshiny-app` module (description="Pipeline for generating an R shiny app for the project.", required=False)
8. `de-go-analysis` module (description="Pipeline for Differential Expression, Volcano Plots, and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis Per Cell Type.", required=False)
9. `project-updates` module (description="Pipeline for summarizing results from all modules and generating project reports.", required=False)
